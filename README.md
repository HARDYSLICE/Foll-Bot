# Foll-Bot
A discord social media bot to help you post attachments and other stuff in a channel. You can also follow other users.

You can share posts and receive notifications.
It comes with cool commands, for example you can create a profile with `.createprofile` and also set a biography on your profile with `.bio`. First you need to set a channel where bot will post, use `.setchannel` to set it(SERVER_OWNER ONLY). A bot with 24/7 uptime

To self-host it:
